# LLM Vault Chat Interface

This project provides a simple chat interface built on top of an LLM-backed vault access system. The vault contains markdown notes that can include hyperlinks (using `[[linked note]]` syntax) to other notes in the vault. The backend, built with Flask, processes chat commands to retrieve or search notes, while the frontend offers a basic chat interface with session-based memory.

## Overview

The LLM Vault Chat Interface integrates a vault-access backend with a chat interface. Users can interact with the vault by entering specific commands:
- **`note: <note_name>`**: Retrieves and displays the content of a specified note.
- **`search: <query>`**: Searches for notes containing the provided query and returns matching results.

Chat history (i.e., conversation memory) is stored in the user's session for the duration of the chat.

## Features

- **Vault Access**: Load markdown notes from a specified directory and extract linked notes.
- **Chat Interface**: A simple web-based chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Command Processing**: Support for commands to retrieve notes or perform keyword searches.
- **Session Memory**: Current chat history is stored using Flask sessions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-vault-chat.git
   cd llm-vault-chat
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the Vault Path**:
   - In the `app.py` file, update the `vault_path` variable with the path to your vault directory (where your markdown notes are stored).

2. **Set a Secure Secret Key**:
   - Update the `app.secret_key` in `app.py` with a secure key for session management.

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Chat Interface**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`.

5. **Chat Commands**:
   - Type `note: <note_name>` to retrieve the content of a note.
   - Type `search: <query>` to search for notes that contain the given query.
   - Any other message will prompt a default help response.

## Code Structure

- **app.py**
  - **Vault Class**:  
    - `_load_notes()`: Loads all markdown files from the specified vault directory.
    - `get_note_content(note_name)`: Retrieves content for a specific note.
    - `extract_links(content)`: Extracts links (using `[[...]]` syntax) from note content.
    - `resolve_links(note_name)`: Retrieves contents of linked notes.
    - `search_notes(query)`: Searches notes for a given query.
  - **Flask Endpoints**:
    - `/`: Renders the chat interface.
    - `/send`: Accepts POST requests to process user messages, update the chat history, and return a JSON response.
  
- **templates/chat.html**
  - Provides a basic chat UI with a chat window and an input form.
  - Uses JavaScript to send messages to the backend and update the chat history dynamically.

## Extending the Application

- **Additional Commands**:  
  Add new commands in the `/send` endpoint of `app.py` to support more complex interactions, such as resolving linked notes or integrating external APIs.
  
- **LLM Integration**:  
  Enhance the chat response generation by integrating a language model (e.g., via OpenAI API) to provide more dynamic and context-aware responses.
  
- **UI Enhancements**:  
  Improve the frontend design by adding more styling or even frameworks like React or Vue if a richer interface is desired.

## Security Considerations

- **Session Security**:  
  Ensure you use a strong secret key in production to protect session data.
  
- **File Access**:  
  Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent unauthorized access to files outside the intended vault directory.

- **Production Deployment**:  
  When deploying, consider using a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) and follow Flaskâ€™s security guidelines.
